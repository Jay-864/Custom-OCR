# Custom-OCR
A deep learning-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system built from scratch using PyTorch. This project is designed to recognize and decode structured text from grayscale images — specifically focused on license plate recognition — using a custom-trained CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network) architecture.
